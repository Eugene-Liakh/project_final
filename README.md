### It is my pet-project. That's a simple to-do app

#### 🔗 Here is the link for the website: https://quickdone-tasker.web.app/

> ℹ️ Now the weather widget only fetches data for Kyiv, which is my current location, but I plan to
> add location auto-detect in the future.

## Website's cross-device optimization table:

| Device | Optimized for the specified device |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Mobile** | ✅ YES  |
| **Tablet** | ✅ YES  |
| **Desktop** | ✅ YES |

The tech-stack:
- Webpack (bundling)
- Firebase (hosting)
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- AJAX (async/await + fetch)
- API (request to openweathermap.org)
- 3-rd party NPM packages for animations

**Feature I am proud of:** Dark-mode autodetect. Basically, the website checks if you are using the dark mode and loads the corresponding style ;) 

> N.B. I developed the design myself, pursuing the pattern for Glassmorhophism
